     <p>I was born on May 23<sup>rd</sup> in Montreal, Quebec, and when I was 12 years old, I moved to Ottawa. I am the middle child among my two siblings, who are a younger brother and an older sister. I enjoy drawing, dancing, going for walks, swimming, and taking lots of naps.</p>
     <p>When I was 12 years old, I got my first pet <abbr title= "His name was Pikachu"> hamster</abbr>, who sadly passed away when I was about to turn 15, but now I have a dog named Zara. I would love to pursue a career in fashion design or anything else that involves the <em>arts and design.</em></p>
